# Connectionist-Model-and-Linguistics: Model For Word Recognition

Connectionism is an extremely broad term that refers to a variety of ideas that approach cognition in an artificial intelligence aspect
by creating numerous connections between nodes at different grain sizes or scales ranging from neurons to hidden behaviours that are 
results of large networks operating in parallel, broken down into simple processing units, grouped into hierarchies generating outcomes
that gives a comprehensible way about of human cognition. There are many connectionist models specifically trained to recognize letter 
strings and compute its meaning have been designed over the years like the triangle framework by Seidenberg McCelland (1989), 
Plaut et al. (1996), and Harm and Seidenberg (1999, 2004). We will be reviewing the basic components that Connectionist models of 
Reading comprises of, triangle framework and the TRACE model developed by McCelland and Elman (1986) to understand the lexical access
on them, their architecture and shortcomings of these models.

Keywords: Connectionist models, triangle framework, TRACE model.
